# How does the song game work?
It gets a random portion of the song for your specified time, and plays it. Your job is to guess the name of the track that plays. A song can be listened to multiple times, but an answer can only be guessed once. A final score is given after all songs are completed.
# Requirements:
`.mp3` files are required to play the game.
